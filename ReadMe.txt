This is just like windowinstaller that will add your libraries to WebSphere Shared library.

Make an executable jar from it or run it from Eclipse etc. Give inputs and it will do its work.

You need to give zip file or folder that will contain jars folder and jars/libraries in it. It will add that path to your shared library and copy that jars to C directory and include C directory path in shared library.
